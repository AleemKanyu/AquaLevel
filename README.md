## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Hardware
- ESP32
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04 or equivalent)
- Breadboard, jumper wires
- Resistors (voltage divider)
- External power source

### Software
- Android Studio
- Kotlin
- Firebase Realtime Database / Firestore
- Arduino IDE

---

## 🧠 System Architecture
1. Sensor measures water level.
2. ESP32 processes the data.
3. Data is sent to Firebase via Wi-Fi.
4. Android app fetches and displays data.
5. Historical data is stored date-wise.

## 🔌 Hardware Connections (Summary)

| Component | ESP32 |
|--------|------|
| VCC | External Power |
| GND | GND |
| TRIG | GPIO Pin |
| ECHO | GPIO Pin (via voltage divider) |

⚠️ ESP32 GPIO pins are **3.3V tolerant**, so a voltage divider is required for ECHO.
